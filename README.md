## Application
### This application allows users to create and manipulate a database containing information listed and populated through the seeded data. This app utilizes packages such ass Express.js, MySQL, and Sequelize to connect and manipulate this database. The following app was tested using Insomnia and can successfull establish GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for all three API routes.

## Usage & Application Creation
### To begin using this application, the user must first establish and seed the database. This can be done by running source db/schema.sql in MySQL Shell, followed by running the npm run seed command in the terminal (this can only be done successfully after the correct packages are installed). Once the database and populated tables are created the user may start the server to test the API GET routes through Insomnia.
